# not-things VCV Rack modules

## Modules
The list of modules in this plugin for [VCV Rack](https://github.com/VCVRack/Rack), a virtual Eurorack modular synthesizer platform:
* [SOLIM](./doc/SOLIM.md): A set of modules with a core idea of limiting note values to an octave range and sorting them

## Themes
All modules have a **light** and a **dark** theme version. By default, the *Follow VCV Panel Theme* option will be active, causing the modules to follow the global panel theme selection of VCV Rack (available in the *Module* section of the VCV Rack *View* menu). This can be changed on a per-module basis in the *Panel theme* submenu of the right-click menu of each module.
